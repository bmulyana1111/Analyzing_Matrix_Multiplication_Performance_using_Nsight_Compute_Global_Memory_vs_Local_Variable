# Analyzing Matrix Multiplication Performance using Nsight Compute: Global Memory vs. Local Variable

Introduction: Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many scientific and computational applications. In CUDA programming, efficient memory management plays a crucial role in achieving high-performance matrix multiplication. We analyze and compare the performance of matrix multiplication [128x128] using global memory [matmul_global_mem.cu] and local variables [matmul_with_local_variable.cu] by leveraging NVIDIA's Nsight Compute profiling tool. Nsight Compute provides valuable insights into the memory access patterns, occupancy, and performance of CUDA kernels, allowing us to optimize our code for better performance.

1. Matrix Multiplication using Global Memory:
When matrix multiplication is performed using global memory, each thread loads data from global memory into its registers and performs the computation. However, accessing global memory can be relatively slow due to its higher latency and limited bandwidth compared to on-chip memory.

2. Matrix Multiplication using Local Variables:
To improve memory access efficiency, we can utilize shared memory (local variables) in CUDA. Shared memory is a low-latency, high-bandwidth memory that is shared among threads within a thread block. By storing data in shared memory, we can minimize global memory access and exploit data reuse within a thread block, thereby improving performance.

3. Profiling with Nsight Compute:
Nsight Compute allows us to profile our CUDA kernels and gain detailed insights into their execution. We can analyze various metrics such as instruction efficiency, memory utilization, and occupancy. By comparing the metrics between the global memory and local variable implementations, we can identify potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

4. Comparing Occupancy:
Occupancy refers to the ratio of active warps per multiprocessor to the maximum possible number of warps. Higher occupancy indicates better utilization of GPU resources. Nsight Compute provides occupancy analysis for our kernels, allowing us to compare the occupancy between the global memory and local variable implementations. By achieving higher occupancy, we can exploit parallelism and improve overall performance. In the GPU utilization section of Nsight Compute, "SM" stands for Streaming Multiprocessor. Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) are the individual processing units within a GPU. Each SM consists of multiple CUDA cores and is responsible for executing parallel threads. SMs handle the execution of CUDA kernels by dividing the workload into smaller units called warps, which are groups of threads that can be executed concurrently on the SM.
In Nsight Compute, the GPU utilization metrics provide information about how effectively the SMs are utilized during the execution of a CUDA kernel. The utilization is typically represented as a percentage and indicates the proportion of time the SMs spend actively executing threads compared to the total time available. Higher SM utilization suggests better utilization of the GPU resources and greater parallelism. Analyzing SM utilization can help identify performance bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts to achieve better performance in CUDA applications. Figure SM below shows the performance of matrix multiplication using the local variable [blue color] has higher memory utilization rather than global memory [green color]

5. Analyzing Memory Access Patterns:
Using Nsight Compute, we can visualize the memory access patterns of our matrix multiplication kernels. We can examine the global memory reads and writes, shared memory usage, and identify any inefficient memory access patterns. By analyzing the memory transactions, we can optimize memory access to minimize global memory loads and maximize shared memory utilization. Within the depicted figure, the memory utilization analysis reveals that the use of local variables in matrix multiplication (indicated by the blue color) results in higher memory utilization than when global memory is employed (represented by the green color).

6. Identifying Performance Bottlenecks:
Using Nsight Compute's performance metrics, we can identify performance bottlenecks in our matrix multiplication kernels. By examining metrics such as warp stall reasons, instruction-level statistics, and memory transactions, we can pinpoint areas of code that may be causing performance degradation. This information helps us focus our optimization efforts to eliminate bottlenecks and improve overall performance. Let's analyze the section labeled "Warp State Statistics," which provides a comprehensive breakdown of the different states that a warp can experience during execution [Figure below]. This data presents the average duration, in cycles per issued instruction, for which warps remain in each state. One specific metric that drew my attention was the "Stall Long Scoreboard." This metric pertains to memory operations and indicates that warps are waiting for memory operations to finish. In the global memory implementation, this metric seems to dominate, suggesting a significant amount of time spent in this state. However, in the local variable kernel, a distinct stall reason referred to as "Stall Allocation Stall" is observed, with considerably fewer cycles spent in this state. Although it is not possible to completely eliminate stalls, their impact can be minimized by leveraging high warp parallelism to conceal their effects on overall performance.

7. Optimizing Performance:
Based on the analysis performed using Nsight Compute, we can optimize our matrix multiplication implementation. Techniques such as loop unrolling, memory coalescing, and shared memory padding can be employed to enhance memory access patterns, increase data reuse, and maximize occupancy. By iteratively optimizing our code and leveraging the insights provided by Nsight Compute, we can achieve significant performance improvements.


Analyzing and comparing matrix multiplication performance using global memory and local variables using Nsight Compute provides valuable insights into the memory access patterns and performance characteristics of our CUDA kernels. By optimizing memory access, maximizing data reuse, and improving occupancy, we can achieve efficient matrix multiplication implementations. Nsight Compute is an indispensable tool for CUDA developers, enabling them to fine-tune their code and unlock the full potential of NVIDIA GPUs for accelerated computations.
